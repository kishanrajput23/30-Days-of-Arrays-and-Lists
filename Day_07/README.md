# Rotate Matrix

### Problem Description

You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You need to do this in place.

**Note**: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.

### Input Format
First argument is a 2D matrix A of integers

### Output Format
Return the 2D rotated matrix.

### Problem Constraints
```
1 <= n <= 1000
```

### Example Input
```
Input 1:
    [
        [1,2],
        [3,4]
    ]

Input 2:
    [
        [1,2,3],
        [4,5,6],
        [7,8,9]
    ]
```

### Example Output
```
Output 1:
    [
        [3,1],
        [4,2]
    ]

Output 2:
    [
        [7,4,1],
        [8,5,2],
        [9,6,3]
    ]
```

### Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:

    After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:
    1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4
    4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1

Explanation 2:

    After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:
    1 goes to 3, 3 goes to 9
    2 goes to 6, 6 goes to 8
    9 goes to 7, 7 goes to 1
    8 goes to 4, 4 goes to 2
```
